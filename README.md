## 🎨 Using Lovable with Qasa

### Getting Started with Lovable

1. **Access the Project**: Visit [https://qasa.lovable.app/](https://qasa.lovable.app/)
2. **Remix the Project**: Click "Remix with Lovable" in the bottom right corner
3. **Start Creating**: Use the content examples below to guide your prompts
4. **Iterate Quickly**: Build on previous versions and refine your ideas

### Effective Prompting for Qasa Prototypes

#### Basic Structure
```
Create a [component/page] for Qasa that [specific goal/function]
Use Qasa's design system and follow their tone of voice
Include real Swedish content and locations
```

#### Example Prompts

**For Landing Pages:**
```
Create a new landing page including parts of the app at start increasing landlords and tenants conversion? Can mix in homes, tenants, main CTA and best practices
```

**For Iterative Design:**
```
Bring in map? Some home cards? Tenant cards? Maybe bento grid? Or carousel like Netflix? And first step "list your home"?
```

**For Tenant-Focused Pages:**
```
Create a new landing page more focused on tenants
```

**For Prototype Modifications:**
```
Make "find tenant" the first screen here in this app route. And add filters similar to this image
```

**For Dashboard Creation:**
```
Replace this page and content and instead create a rental dashboard for a landlord who is viewing their home that is currently rented by a tenant. Use components from storybooks
```

**For User Flows:**
```
Create a 5-step tenant registration flow for Qasa
Include profile completion with progress tracking
Use Qasa's safety messaging and trust indicators
```

**For Components:**
```
Create a Qasa Premium feature card showing "Super apply" benefits
Include the 2.5x improvement messaging
Use Qasa's color scheme and typography
```

### Iterative Prototyping Strategy

**Start Broad, Then Refine:**
1. **Initial Prompt**: Create a basic version with your main goal
2. **Iteration Prompts**: Ask for specific improvements or additions
3. **Refinement**: Polish details and interactions

**Example Iteration Flow:**
```
1. "Create a new landing page including parts of the app at start increasing landlords and tenants conversion"
2. "Bring in map? Some home cards? Tenant cards? Maybe bento grid? Or carousel like Netflix?"
3. "Add first step 'list your home' and improve the CTA buttons"
```

**Quick Modifications:**
- **Change Focus**: "Make this more tenant-focused instead of landlord-focused"
- **Add Features**: "Include a search bar and filter options"
- **Improve Layout**: "Use a bento grid layout like modern landing pages"
- **Enhance UX**: "Add progress indicators and better navigation"

### Content Guidelines

- **Accurate statistics**: 5+ million applications, 600,000+ homes
- **Qasa's value props**: No deposit, guaranteed rent, expert support
